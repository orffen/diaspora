# The Diaspora Toolbox

## Introduction

The Diaspora Toolbox is a collection of [Python](https://www.python.org) scripts
designed to speed up random generation of various Diaspora RPG things.

The scripts are written in Python; you'll need an installation of Python on your
system to run them. Python is available at <http://www.python.org>.

The SWN Toolbox is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/orffen/diaspora).

## Installation

No installation is required; simply extract the file into a folder of your
choice. The .py files can be run directly from the command-line, e.g.:

- python sector.py

If you're running in a Windows environment, you most likely don't have
Python installed. You can download Python for free from <http://www.python.org>.

## Usage

In this release, each script is designed to be run directly from the
command-line.

Every script in the collection supports a single command-line argument:

- a number, which specifies the amount of items to generate.

For example: `python sector.py 6` will generate a sector with 6 star systems.
